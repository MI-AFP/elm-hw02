It has been translated into almost all of the world\'s major languages. Around one million copies are sold each year, with total sales of more than 65 million books. The novel\'s protagonist Holden Caulfield has become an icon for teenage rebellion. The novel also deals with complex issues of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, and connection.'
